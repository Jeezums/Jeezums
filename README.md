- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jeezums
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a game developer and taking my skills to the next level.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning as a solo devloper in Unity, making prototype game systems in 2D and 3D to practice and get better.
- 💞️ I’m looking to become part of a team where I can grow as a developer and contribute to the industry in any way I can.
- 📫 The best way to reach me would be at my email at joshpetersdev@gmail.com.
